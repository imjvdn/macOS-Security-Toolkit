## üéØ Features

- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Collect system, user, and network security information on macOS
- **Security Compliance**: Evaluate systems against CIS and NIST benchmarks for macOS
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic dashboards and reports for security analysis
- **Easy to Use**: Simple, intuitive scripts for security professionals
- **Detailed Reporting**: Multiple output formats for analysis and documentation
- **macOS Native**: Designed specifically for macOS security architecture and tools

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/macOS-Security-Toolkit.git
cd macOS-Security-Toolkit

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/**/*.sh

# Run a basic system security audit
./scripts/audit-tools/system-security-audit.sh
```

## üíª How to Use This Toolkit

This toolkit provides multiple ways to perform security audits and generate reports:

### 1. Ready-to-Use Security Scripts

The easiest way to get started is to use our ready-made security scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd scripts

# Run a comprehensive security assessment that combines multiple tools
./complete-security-assessment.sh --target localhost --include-network-scan --include-tls-check

# Or run individual audit tools
cd audit-tools
./system-security-audit.sh
./user-accounts-audit.sh
```

### 2. Advanced Usage

For advanced users who want more control, individual modules can be used separately or combined in custom workflows.

## üîí Security Scripts

### Audit Tools

The `scripts/audit-tools/` directory contains scripts for security auditing and assessment:

- **system-security-audit.sh**: Comprehensive system-wide security audit
- **user-accounts-audit.sh**: Focused audit of user accounts and permissions
- **network-security-audit.sh**: Network configuration and security assessment
- **security-compliance-check.sh**: Evaluates system against CIS and NIST security benchmarks
- **malware-scan.sh**: Scans for indicators of compromise and potential threats
- **network-port-scan.sh**: Native port scanner for network security assessment
- **tls-security-check.sh**: Checks SSL/TLS configurations and certificate security

### Incident Response Tools

- **collect-forensic-evidence.sh**: Gathers system artifacts with proper hashing and chain of custody
- **export-volatile-data.sh**: Captures memory dumps and volatile system state

### Reporting Tools

The `scripts/reporting-tools/` directory contains tools for generating professional reports from audit data:

- **convert-audit-to-html.sh**: Converts audit data to interactive HTML reports
- **generate-executive-summary.sh**: Creates executive-level summary of security findings
- **convert-audit-to-dashboard.sh**: Creates interactive security dashboards from audit data

## üß™ Testing

To ensure the toolkit works correctly on your system, run the included tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
./run-tests.sh
