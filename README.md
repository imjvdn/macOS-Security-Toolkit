## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/imjvdn/macOS-Security-Toolkit.git
cd macOS-Security-Toolkit

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/**/*.sh

# Run a basic system security audit
./scripts/audit-tools/system-security-audit.sh
```

## üíª How to Use This Toolkit

This toolkit provides multiple ways to perform security audits and generate reports:

### 1. Ready-to-Use Security Scripts

The easiest way to get started is to use our ready-made security scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd scripts/audit-tools

# Run a system security audit
./system-security-audit.sh

# Run a network port scan
./network-port-scan.sh --target localhost --scan-type quick

# Check TLS/SSL security
./tls-security-check.sh --target example.com
```

### 2. Advanced Usage

For advanced users who want more control, individual modules can be used separately or combined in custom workflows.

## üìö Documentation

### Security Command References

The `docs/` directory contains reference guides for common security commands and tools on macOS:

- [macOS Security Cheat Sheet](docs/macos-security-cheat-sheet.md): Quick reference for security commands

## üîí Security Scripts

### Audit Tools

The `scripts/audit-tools/` directory contains scripts for security auditing and assessment:

- **system-security-audit.sh**: Comprehensive system-wide security audit
- **network-port-scan.sh**: Native port scanner for network security assessment
- **tls-security-check.sh**: Checks SSL/TLS configurations and certificate security

### Incident Response Tools

- **collect-forensic-evidence.sh**: Gathers system artifacts with proper hashing and chain of custody

### Reporting Tools

The `scripts/reporting-tools/` directory will contain tools for generating professional reports from audit data (coming soon).

## üß™ Testing

Test scripts will be added in future updates to ensure the toolkit works correctly on your system.
