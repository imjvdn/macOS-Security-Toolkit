The macOS Security Toolkit is a collection of security tools designed specifically for macOS environments. It includes scripts for comprehensive system security audits, network port scanning, SSL/TLS configuration checking, and forensic evidence collection with proper chain of custody documentation.

Unlike many security tools that are ported from other platforms, this toolkit is built natively for macOS, leveraging built-in commands and utilities for maximum compatibility and minimal dependencies. Perfect for security professionals, system administrators, and privacy-conscious users who need to assess and improve the security posture of their macOS systems.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/imjvdn/macOS-Security-Toolkit.git
cd macOS-Security-Toolkit

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/**/*.sh

# Run a basic system security audit
./scripts/audit-tools/system-security-audit.sh
```

## üíº How to Use This Toolkit

This toolkit provides multiple ways to perform security audits and generate reports:

### 1. Ready-to-Use Security Scripts

The easiest way to get started is to use our ready-made security scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd scripts/audit-tools

# Run a system security audit
./system-security-audit.sh

# Run a network port scan
./network-port-scan.sh --target localhost --scan-type quick

# Check TLS/SSL security
./tls-security-check.sh --target example.com
```

### 2. Advanced Usage

For advanced users who want more control, individual modules can be used separately or combined in custom workflows.

<summary>üîç Script Examples</summary>

### system-security-audit.sh

```bash
./system-security-audit.sh [--output-dir /path/to/output]
```

Performs a comprehensive security audit of the macOS system, collecting information about:
- System configuration and security settings
- User accounts and permissions
- Network settings and connections
- Running processes and services
- Installed applications
- Security settings and policies

#### Output Files

The script creates the following files in the output directory:
- SystemInfo.txt
- SecuritySettings.txt
- UserAccounts.txt
- NetworkConfig.txt
- RunningProcesses.txt
- InstalledApplications.txt

### user-account-audit.sh

```bash
./user-account-audit.sh
```

Performs a comprehensive audit of user accounts on the macOS system, identifying:
- Accounts with admin privileges
- Password policies and expiration settings
- Login history and failed login attempts
- Suspicious accounts (UID 0, empty passwords, non-standard shells)

#### Output Files

The script creates the following files in the output directory:
- user_details.csv: Details of all user accounts
- password_policies.csv: Password policy information
- login_history.txt: Recent login history
- failed_logins.txt: Failed login attempts
- summary.md: Summary report with findings and recommendations

```

Analyzes the macOS firewall configuration, checking:
- Firewall status and settings
- Stealth mode configuration
- Allowed applications
- Blocked connection attempts
- Logging configuration

#### Output Files

The script creates the following files in the output directory:
- firewall_status.md: Current firewall configuration
- allowed_applications.md: Applications allowed through the firewall
- blocked_connections.md: Recent blocked connection attempts
- recommendations.md: Security recommendations
- summary.md: Summary report with security score

### malware-scanner.sh

```bash
./malware-scanner.sh
```

Scans the system for potential malware and suspicious activity:
- Suspicious launch agents and daemons
- Processes with unusual behavior or high resource usage
- Browser extensions that might be malicious
- Suspicious cron jobs
- Unusual network connections

#### Output Files

The script creates the following files in the output directory:
- launch_agents.md: Suspicious launch agents and daemons
- suspicious_processes.md: Processes with unusual behavior
- browser_extensions.md: Installed browser extensions
- cron_jobs.md: Scheduled tasks that might be suspicious

## üíº Security Scripts

### Audit Tools

The `scripts/audit-tools/` directory contains scripts for security auditing and assessment:

- **system-security-audit.sh**: Comprehensive system-wide security audit
- **user-account-audit.sh**: Audits user accounts for security issues and policy compliance
- **firewall-analyzer.sh**: Analyzes firewall configuration and provides security recommendations
- **malware-scanner.sh**: Scans for potential malware and suspicious activity
- **network-port-scan.sh**: Native port scanner for network security assessment
- **tls-security-check.sh**: Checks SSL/TLS configurations and certificate security

### Incident Response Tools

### Reporting Tools

The `scripts/reporting-tools/` directory contains tools for generating professional reports from audit data:

- **generate-baseline-report.sh**: Creates comprehensive baseline security reports by running all audit tools
- **format-security-report.sh**: Formats security data into various output formats (Markdown, HTML, JSON, CSV, PDF)

## üìä Baseline Reporting

The toolkit includes tools to generate comprehensive baseline security reports by running all audit tools and consolidating their outputs:

```bash
# Generate a baseline report in markdown format
./scripts/reporting-tools/generate-baseline-report.sh

# Generate a report in HTML format
./scripts/reporting-tools/generate-baseline-report.sh --format html

# Generate a report in a specific directory
./scripts/reporting-tools/generate-baseline-report.sh --output-dir ~/Desktop/security-reports
```

Reports include:

For more information, see [scripts/reporting-tools/README.md](scripts/reporting-tools/README.md).

## üß™ Testing

The toolkit includes a comprehensive test framework to ensure all scripts function correctly.

```bash
# Run the test suite
./tests/run-tests.sh
```

The test framework:
- Verifies that all scripts exist and are executable
- Runs each script with safe test parameters
- Validates script output against expected patterns
